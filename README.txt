Overview
	Hello and welcome to this quick video overview of our graphical user interface. As you can see, this is the main screen you'll be using. Let's start from the top, where we have three buttons in the menubar: Admin, QR Code Generator, and About.

	Below the menubar, we have a service order table that displays all your service orders. Each row shows the Service Order number, Location, Completion Date, Closed By, Status, Comments, Last Updated, and Updated By. This table will be your go-to place to track all your service orders.

	At the bottom of the screen, you'll find an input box labeled SO, which stands for Service Order number. Here, you can scan a service order to add it to the table, check it out from the table, or view already checked-out service orders.

	In the left bottom corner, you'll see a Delete button that allows you to delete a specific entry one at a time. On the right side, there's a Rescan button that lets you rescan a service order location if it has been moved. Additionally, you'll see a calendar icon that enables you to find a specific order using filters.

	That's it for this quick overview of our graphical user interface. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Thanks for watching!

Adding Service Order:

	Adding a service order is a simple process that takes less than 20 seconds. Let me walk you through the steps. First, click on the input box to make sure it's selected. Then, scan the service order barcode. If the barcode is not entered properly, you'll receive an error message.

	After scanning the service order, a Location window will appear, asking you to scan the location barcode. If the location is already in use, you'll see a warning message asking you to confirm if you want to add the service order to the same location. You can press 'Yes' to confirm or go back to the Location window to enter a new location.

	Next, a Select Agent window will appear, where you can select the agent who handling this service order. Once you've selected the agent, a Confirm window will appear to double-check your selection. If everything is correct, you can press 'Yes' to proceed.

	After that, a Status window will appear, asking you to choose whether the service order is in the green or yellow status. If you select green, you can add optional comments in the Comments window that appears. If you select yellow, you must enter comments before you can proceed.

	Finally, press the 'Submit' button to add the service order to the table. And that's it! The service order will now be displayed in the table along with the location, completion date, closed by, status, comments, and other information.

	Thanks for watching, and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!

Checking out service order:

	To check a service order out, you'll need to scan its barcode or enter last 4 digit of service order and then selecting your service order in window list. Once you've scanned the barcode, a Select Agent window will appear, where you can select the agent who is handling the service order. After selecting the agent, a Confirm window will appear to double-check your selection. If everything is correct, press 'Yes' to proceed.

	After pressing 'Yes,' the service order will be removed from the table, but it's not deleted. In the next video, I'll show you how you can find it again.

	That's it for checking out a service order. Thanks for watching, and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!


View checkout service order:

	If you want to view a service order that has been checked out, you'll need to scan its barcode. Once you've scanned the barcode, a Service Order Details window will appear. This window is divided into two parts.

	The top part shows the service order information, such as the service order number, location, completion date, closed by, status, comments, and other relevant information.

	The bottom part shows the service order updates, which lists when updates were made, who made them, and what was changed. This allows you to keep track of the service order history and see any updates that were made while it was checked out.

	That's it for viewing a checked-out service order. Thanks for watching, and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!


Edit Service Order info:

	If you need to edit a service order for any reason, you can do so by double-clicking on the service order inside the table. This will open a window where you can edit the service order information.

	First, a Select Agent window will appear, where you can choose the agent who is editing the service order. After selecting the agent, a Confirm window will appear to double-check your selection. If everything is correct, press 'Yes' to proceed.

	After confirming your selection, an Edit Service Order window will appear. In this window, you can change the service order information, such as the location, closed by, status, comments and add res codes. Res Codes can be only added by ARA Agents if you start editing service order at beginning as CA Agent you will be not available to add res code, so you would have to close a window and ask a permission from ARA to stat editing service order under their name.


	Additionally, under the Edit Service Order window, you'll see the updates that have been made to this service order. This allows you to keep track of any changes that have been made to the service order over time.


	After pressing submit service order will be updated!

	That's it for editing a service order. Thanks for watching, and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!
